### Estimated Hours

2.5 hours total, around 30 minutes of learning.

### Content Insights

Local hosting allows for efficient testing and developing in a controlled environment for their CMS-based website. Local hosting is also
more secure because the website will not be exposed to the internet until you're finished.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

The practical this week didn't offer any links for us to follow. The task was just a brief description. At first this can be a little
overwhelming and vague, however there were many ways to complete this practical. I went through the other resources provided, and that's
when I found all the available ways to begin hosting locally (https://github.com/CP3402/subject/wiki/Resources#hosting). Local hosting
skills are highly valuable in various technology-related careers, such as professional growth in web development, DevOps, software testing.
and more.
