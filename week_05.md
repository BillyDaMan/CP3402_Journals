### Estimated Hours

2.5 hours total, around 1 hour of learning.

### Content Insights

Child themes allow you to make modifications without editing the parent theme's files, making sure that your customisations remain intact when the parent theme is updated. Learning about child themes also gave an insight for learning about WordPress theme develpoment. However I find child themes a little unnecessary because the theme's style sheet can be edited through the provided CSS file as you go, and any mistake made I can revert.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Understanding child themes for WordPress can make you look more employable as they are commonly used in CMS development and display technical proficiency. It also teaches you a little about how themes are created in WordPress, which is a foundation in theme development. I understand why leanring how to use child themes can make you more efficient when developing CMSs.
