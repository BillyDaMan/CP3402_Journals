### Learning Activities & Resources

I learned how to publish a website using github pages by watching a turtorial and following the steps provided by github.
I tried a different approach this time when creating the website, using bootsrap's templates to try save time.
Also I'm getting familiar with markdown (*as it is used in the industry*) using other people's work as an example .


### Estimated Hours

5 hours total, around 4 hours of learning.


### Content Insights

I learned how to take advantage of website templates like **Bootstrap**. With their coding style,
it took a little getting used to what did what. Once I understood mostly everything it was
pretty easy, and will provide being a useful tool and timesaver in the future.


### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Learning markdown and getting more comfortable with github is important to me as they are industry standards.
Everytime I use github I understand more and more why poeple use it.
Also learning how to take advantage of what is already out there to save time is helpful (e.g. bootstrap).
What I leanred this week I could see as being useful for a lot of career's, especially any involving web development.
