### Estimated Hours

4 hours total, around 2 hours of learning.


### Content Insights

Content Management Systems are a one stop shop for startup companies. It offers website hosting and easy website editing with the help of
extensions, templates, and plugins (which we'll learn more about later). However, the training videos offered by Joomla are a little outdated,
which can make it slightly more difficult to learn from. Using Joomla is the first step into getting familiar with Content Management Systems
in general.


### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Content Management Systems are popular and used for small startup companies. However, it seems Joomla is not as popular as something like
WordPress, which has over a 62% market share on websites according to my research. Learning Joomla is useful to know for career
opportunities because other Content Management Systems share a similar foundation. Over 76 million websites use a CMS, which proves its
popularity in today's market.
