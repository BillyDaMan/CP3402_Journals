# Week 8 - Learning Experiments

### Learning Theory
If I were to spread out my learning over the five weekdays,    
then I'll average a higher time spent learning,     
because it is easier to split something into smaller pieces rather than to do it all at once

### Learning Activities & Resources
- Spend around 30 mintues a day over five days of learning time
- Continue to watch LinkedIn video "Introducing PHP"
- Started watching "WordPress: Building Themes from Scratch Using Underscores" on LinkedIn

### Estimated Hours
2.5 hours of learning

### Learning Insights
While only doing 30 minutes a day rather than 1 or 2 hours over a couple of days, I felt it was easier to concentrate on what I was learning. I also averaged a higher estimated learning time. However, this method did require more motivation to do every day, especially when I have other subjects to worry about. Repetition is also important when trying to remember what you learnt, which is why doing a little bit every day helped (it was easier to recall what I was learning from yesterday verses a week). I found this to be a much more efficient way of learning compared to what I usually do.
